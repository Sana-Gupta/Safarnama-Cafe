# Safarnama-Cafe
A Simple Resturant Management System Project in PHP

The first ever Hindi novel that I read was Divya Prakash Dubey’s-Musafir Café .Musafir Café, it talks about dreams and love, and how when intertwined, can create so many problems, yet bring so much peace.My inspiration for this project lies behind this novel. I tried to recreate Safarnama Cafe.
